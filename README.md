My name is Youssef el habchi, from [React Native Master](https://rn-master.com) I welcome each and everyone of you.




Hello everyone, welcome to this new article, where we are going to explore the React Native Netinfo Api.That gets the current network data in realtime.


Feel free to read the whole article on my blog [React Native Netinfo Example](https://rn-master.com/react-native-netinfo-example/)
If you would like to try the app on Expo, I have prepared an expo project, check it from  [Expo.io](https://exp.host/@alhydra/React-Native-Netinfo-Example)
